**Problem Statement** :-

Fintech entities/Banks/NBFC's Dealing In-Store Products such as Consumer Loans
frequently face financial losses due to Lapses during sourcing.

**This Project's Goal is to Design a Model to Detect Whether Photo captured during sourcing is a Live Photo or a Screengrab**

##  Fraud Modus operandi:-


- Scenario :- Sourcing Agent Takes Screenshot from a Digital Source instead of Live Photo of Customer

## Project Steps ##

- Building a Data Pipeline
- Preprocessing Images
- Creating a Deep Neural network Classifier
- Evaluating Model performance
- Saving Model for Deployment

## Project Steps ##

Created a CNN Model and Saved Model
